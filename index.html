        <h2>Saturday Breakfast Buffet!</h2>
        <p>
          This wonderful buffet will be the start of your morning. Hopefully that will offset however early you have to wake up. It also better have bacon. Seriously, what kind of buffet doesn't have bacon? That's like a place promising tasty treats and not having pretzels.

      <div class="inner-modal inactive" id="kelsey-3">
        <h2>Saturday Dinner Buffet!</h2>
        <p>
          Buffet for breakfast, buffet for dinner. No idea what your having for lunch, but this buffet better have chicken and fries.

        <h2>Saturday Night Dance!</h2>
        <p>
          Dance? Who said anything about a dance? Why is there a dance? Anyways, this is part of your night if you choose to participate.

      <div class="inner-modal inactive" id="kelsey-5">
        <h2>Saturday Night Entertainment!</h2>
        <p>
          This is very non-specific. I have no idea what you'll be doing, if it's at the same time as the dance, or if it's any fun. But there's 'Entertainment'...

          Wrap up the weekend listening to an inspiring speaker while enjoying a delicious breakfast of eggs, bacon, and sausage, hash browns, danish, fruit, yogurt and more."
          <br>
          <br>
          At least this one has bacon! And hashbrowns! And an inspiring speaker that may or may not be part of the menu...

        Welcome to the N.P.O.W - The North Pole Online Workshop. Here at the North Pole, we have a very strict policy on wrapping gifts. Everything must be wrapped. But as gifts started to become digital, we ran into some problems. How can you wrap an angry birds app? Or a computer download? In ages past, we would just wrap a piece of paper. But that seems rather boring compared to opening a real gift. So instead, Santa and the elves created the North Pole Online Workshop. Here, we can digiatally wrap your gifts and deliver them to you without leaving the North Pole. Isn't technology great?
